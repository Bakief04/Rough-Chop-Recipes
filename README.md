My project was meant to have a cooking / recipe website that went directly to the recipes. This way you wouldn't have a entire novel before you got to the recipe. It would be straight to the point with no fluff added before the actual recipe.

The features I implimented are a responsive mobile navigation. 
A grid layout that sizes a nav bar, paragraph and image elements, and a footer.
An auto-rotating Image Carousel
A hamburger style menu for mobile menus written in javascript.
And a weight conversion that takes ounces and converts it into grams, and cups for purposes of reading recipe amounts easier.
