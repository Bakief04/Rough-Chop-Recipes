This is my project, Hope you like it.

The features I implimented are a responsive mobile navigation. 
A grid layout that sizes a nav bar, paragraph and image elements, and a footer.
A hamburger style menu for mobile menus written in javascript.
And a weight conversion that takes ounces and converts it into grams, and cups for purposes of reading recipe amounts easier.
